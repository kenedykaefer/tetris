# tetris_ai

## Description

`tetris_ai` is a project that combines the classic Tetris game with artificial intelligence. The goal is to develop a functional Tetris game and then implement and train an AI to play the game.

## Features

- Classic Tetris game with updated graphics and mechanics.
- Preview of the next piece to be played.
- Detection and removal of complete lines.
- Implementation of an AI to play Tetris.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame for game implementation
- NumPy for Tetris piece manipulation
- AI algorithms (to be defined)
